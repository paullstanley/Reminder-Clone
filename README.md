# Reminder-Clone
Clone of the native "Reminders" App on iOS implemented using primitive SwiftUI types

1. Create an iOS project
2. Select SwiftUI as the language and Swift as the library.
3. Either replace the ContentView contents with the contents of this git or clone this git into your projects directory and then replace "ContentView()" in your app's main entry (@main) with "LandingPageView()".
